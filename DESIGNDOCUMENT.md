## Function
The purpose of this document is like most creative projects to help maintain a general feeling of what a developed world looks like and feels like. It will provide general guidelines of what is and isn't allowed in the world development and should be read primarily by only those looking to help develop the setting, and not those who wish to have the setting spoiled for them. If you do not wish to have the setting spoiled, this is the time to turn back. [Back to the Introduction](README.md)

This will be the only document in addition to the README, that will not be written in formatting for https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/, so /page breaks will not be mandatory, and additions will be heavily restricted to the Repository owners, and possibly additions via pull requests, though these will be heavily vetted.

This document is the guiding document to the rest, and changes here will change the flow and feel of the rest of the documents. Keeping them consistent with these guidelines is paramount, and as such pull requests that aid in this are muchly appreciated. Though like most pull requests these will be heavily vetted for inclusion in the history, and development of the World.

We are Tolkien, Not reliable Storytellers. Leave that to the DM's and players, we are here to give them something to work with.

# General Aesthetic
The Caverns of the Vaal is a High Fantasy setting set in a huge underground network of caves. It is inhabited by many familiar races from the D&D mythology, as well as a variety of races that are not from the mythology.
