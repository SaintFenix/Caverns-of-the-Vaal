## Function
The purpose of this document is like most creative projects to help maintain a general feeling of what a developed world looks like and feels like. It will provide general guidelines of what is and isn't allowed in the world development and should be read primarily by only those looking to help develop the setting, and not those who wish to have the setting spoiled for them. If you do not wish to have the setting spoiled, this is the time to turn back. [Back to the Introduction](README.md)

This will be the only document in addition to the README, that will not be written in formatting for https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/, so /page breaks will not be mandatory, and additions will be heavily restricted to the Repository owners, and possibly additions via pull requests, though these will be heavily vetted.

This document is the guiding document to the rest, and changes here will change the flow and feel of the rest of the documents. Keeping them consistent with these guidelines is paramount, and as such pull requests that aid in this are muchly appreciated. Though like most pull requests these will be heavily vetted for inclusion in the history, and development of the World.

We are Tolkien, Not reliable Storytellers. Leave that to the DM's and players, we are here to give them something to work with.

# General Aesthetic:
The Caverns of the Vaal is a High Fantasy setting set in a huge underground network of caves. It is inhabited by many familiar races from the D&D mythology, as well as a variety of races that are not from the mythology.

The overall feel of the world is one of mystery, as the various races have been very superstitious as to why the entire world is underground, and why the giant holes (Galadin) that allow the light into the caverns don't exist in every cavern, and why no-one who returns from attempting to venture into them, comes back sane or whole. Depending on how high they ascended into the Galadin, they return more and more sick, and even descending them back into the Vaal will cause partial and very serious symptoms, from dizziness to death. There are stages of this sickness that will be defined, it is important to note here that no-one who has gone too far into them has returned the same, or at all.

According to popular knowledge no-one has ever made it to the top of a Galadin.

There will be mysterious figures, or heroes who will have been to the top, but they will remain mysterious, or insane, and as such will never prove to be reliable narrators to the top. This will always be left a mystery.

## The Vaal:
A Single Vaal can be large enough to have several races living in or, or just one depending on how the history of that Vaal developed, intrigue, god worship, and all the mundanities of life occur in the Vaal and some are quite peaceful or quite far away.

### Climate
Vaal Climates vary highly, from some vaal being vast forests lit by Galadin, to Dark Vaal which have no light but are home to huge white jungles full of predators and prey. They can be cold and snowy, and can be quite windy. Some are home to large kingdoms and civilizations, others are home to small remnants of once great empires, or are completely deserted. Many different kinds of Vaal exist, and some are quite isolated from the other Vaal, providing huge places of great reward and danger for the Adventurer, and many things to discover hidden in the Rock Walls.

#### The Climate of the Vaal depends on it's weather:
The key to the climate of any Vaal is it's water supply. Vaal can have water that comes from rivers, falls from the Galadin in Great lit water falls, or constantly precipitates from the top of the cavern where it gathers on the cold stone. Depending on how much water is available and the temperature, will determine of the Vaal is a great overly lit desert, or a cold dark hell full of yeti's, Grevlin,  

Depending on what warmth radiates from the earth or Galadin, they are often heated by volcanic activity which keeps the Vaal warm enough to grow food, and in rare cases warm enough to grow jungles.

Vaal can have rivers of water, Magma, or Quicksilver passing through the, depending on where they are, and these rivers usually run from the inside of the Vaal into caverns, or sometimes passing through a Vaal entirely.

Some Vaal can be gigantic seas which can have either completely erratic weather patterns, or no wind at all. A few Oceanic Vaal are used as a method of transport between Vaal, and some Vaal will have seaports to maintain this.

Vaal can have mountains that get quite tall, though exceedingly few will ever have snow on them,

Some Vaal have collapsed in antiquity and some have Collapsed more recently, the reasons vary and this has occured from time to time, this can destroy access to Galadin, with terrible consequences for all involved or near.

### Lighted Vaal:
Lightened Vaal are where most civilizations live, they are lit by the massive or sometimes not so massive Galadin. These large holes in the ceilings of the Vaal are where the warmth and light come from. They radiate a magic light that reaches far farther normal light, and shadows under and around Galadin are blurry and faint, as the magic light works it's way through the Vaal. Many cities in lighted Vaal will be built directly underneath Galadin, or along cross roads between them.

### Dark Vaal:

### Cave or Vaal?

The Denizens of Siraga are divided on what constitutes a Vaal, most commonly it is classified, as a cave large enough to house a town with or without a Galadin. Vaal can have multiple entrances in it's walls, and some can be quite large, and other quite small. Many of which are unexplored, or were used in Antiquity by other races, or as burial places.

Caves are almost always one way in, one way out affairs, that connect one or more Vaal. Caves can be quite large themselves some with room for wagons, and others with barely enough room to squeeze a single adventurer through. They can be completely dry with the usual stalagtites and stalagmites that other caves do, or quite warm and wet with fungi or plants. If near enough to a large Galadin these can be lit naturally for miles, if not, they are completely black, though other plants or natural effects may light them.

## Definitions:

Galadin - The gigantic skies, or holes in the top of lighted Vaal, they can be a variety of sizes from holes a hundred feet across to hundreds of thousands. They allow light into the lighted Vaal, and is notably where most of the population of Siraga lives. They are used as guiding lights and do darken at "Night" Though only to a much calmer more twilit light. Only Dark Vaal will ever see true darkness. They radiate a magic light that reaches far farther normal light, and shadows under and around Galadin are blurry and faint. Their brightness can vary from one Vaal to another, getting as bright as Sunlight.

Galadin Sickness (The Gally) - The Sickness that any creature not native to the Galadin goes through as they return to the Vaal. The effects differ per Galadin, but generally cause sickness, to insanity, to death. It is generally assumed that its effect on the magic in all beings veins destroys them, though this also seems to affect non-sentient, and non-organic creatures and constructions to some lesser or dramatic degrees.

Siraga - The planet on which the Vaal reside, it is inhabited as far as we know only in the Vaal beneath it's surface. It's surface while being defined as existing is a mystery and is left such intentionally.

Vaal - The Large Caverns that exist on Siraga and stretch across it's surface. Some of which are exceptionally large, and some of which are lit by the Galadin, and others which are not. These are where civilization meeks out a more or less prosperous existance depending on which race, and which time period is being talked about.
