# The Caverns of the Vaal
A DND 5th Edition OGL Campaign Setting, with open sourced development from the community.

# Overview

The Caverns of the Vaal is an OLG Campaign Setting as written by SaintFenix. It's meant as both a basis and ongoing campaign setting as an alternative to the Forgotten realms. It has a variety of inspirations, and functions as a hobby for myself to add to as time goes on. It will eventually in time include a monster manual, a semi-comprehensive history of the setting, as well as helpful suggestions to DM's who wish to base a campaign in this setting.

## Contributions

 Pull requests are welcome, but subject to heavy scrutiny, as such unless the addition fits REALLY well with the setting, or points out obvious flaws in the writing, or contradictions, it may not be accepted. New contributors are always welcome, though I would suggest opening a small pull request first and discussing intended additions before they are accepted.
