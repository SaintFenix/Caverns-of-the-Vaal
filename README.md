# The Caverns of the Vaal
A DND 5th Edition OGL Campaign Setting, with open sourced development from the community.

# Git Overview:

The Caverns of the Vaal is an OLG Campaign Setting as written by SaintFenix. It's meant as both a basis and ongoing campaign setting as an alternative to the Forgotten realms. The world setting has a variety of inspirations, and functions as a hobby for myself to add to as time goes on. It will eventually in time include a monster manual, a semi-comprehensive history of the setting, as well as helpful suggestions to DM's who wish to base a campaign in this setting. There will be little consistency to my additions and they may come in all at once or slowly over the months. However the Repo will grow with both original Art and more text as the setting is developed.

## Goals:

The Goal of the Repository is to establish around a 2500 year history of the Caverns of Vaal, the creation of several campaigns in the setting, as well as the story of many


## Contributions:

 Pull requests are welcome, but subject to heavy scrutiny, as such unless the addition fits REALLY well with the setting, or points out obvious flaws in the writing, or contradictions, it may not be accepted. New contributors are always welcome, though I would suggest opening a small pull request first and discussing intended additions before writing the bulk of an addition before they are accepted. Language corrections or fixes for misspellings or grammatically incorrect passages or words, are always accepted.

## Compiling:

Due to the nature of this Repo not being actual code, the only real method to "compile" it would be to render it in the form with which was intended: D&D style pages as if this came out of the actual player and Dungeon Master Manuals. The method used will be via "The Homebrewery" located here: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/

The goal here is to make all pages fit as though they were natural in a D&D 5th edition style printing and all contributions will be expected to use this method. E.G. seperating large paragraphs into small concise information and creating \Page demarcations every few pages. These can be checked on https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ at any time to see what they look like
