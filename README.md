# The Caverns of the Vaal
A DND 5th Edition OGL Campaign Setting, with open sourced development from the community.

# World Overview:

WIP

# Git Overview:

The Caverns of the Vaal is an OGL Campaign Setting as written by SaintFenix. It's meant as both a basis and ongoing campaign setting as an alternative to the Forgotten realms.This world setting has a variety of inspirations, and functions as a hobby for myself to add to as time goes on. It will eventually in time include a monster manual, a semi-comprehensive history of the setting, as well as helpful suggestions to DM's who wish to base a campaign in this setting. There will be little consistency to my additions and they may come in all at once or slowly over the months. However the Repo will grow with both original Art and more text as the setting is developed.

## Goals:

The Goal of the Repository is to establish around a 2500 year history of the Caverns of Vaal, the creation of several campaigns in the setting, as well as the smaller histories, linguistics, origins, families, and political intrigues of the Caverns of Vaal. The setting will never be completely considered to be complete, but will grow as is necessary and as portions of it are finished.

The Original spells, creatures, and races of the "Forgotten Realms" will be used for now, as stand ins as some of them will in time be replaced with separate races designed just for the purpose of the setting. This also goes for spells, monsters, and deities of the realm.

It should be additionally noted that when possible, open-endedness as well as room to conjecture and modify should be preferred over closed stories. To allow GM's and players room to fill in their own campaigns and designs in the Caverns of the Vaal.

For a general idea of what the setting is supposed to feel like, please reference the Design Document:

## Contributions:

 Pull requests are welcome, but subject to heavy scrutiny, as such unless the addition fits REALLY well with the setting, or points out obvious flaws in the writing, or contradictions, it may not be accepted. New contributors are always welcome, though I would suggest opening a small pull request first and discussing intended additions before writing the bulk of an addition before they are accepted. Language corrections or fixes for misspellings or grammatically incorrect passages or words, are always accepted.

 Art is always given a priority as well as I have limited artistic abilities, and would very much appreciate art donated to the project. Higher quality will be subjective and I reserve the right to chose the aesthetic that fits the theme of the story best. Nevertheless pull requests with art will be more subjective.

## Compiling:

Due to the nature of this Repo not being actual code, the only real method to "compile" it would be to render it in the form with which was intended: D&D style pages as if this came out of the actual player and Dungeon Master Manuals. The method used will be via "The Homebrewery" located here: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/.

The goal here is to make all pages fit as though they were natural in a D&D 5th edition style printing and all contributions will be expected to use this method. E.G. separating large paragraphs into small concise information and creating \Page demarcations at the end of every page. These can be checked on https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/ at any time to see what they look like.
