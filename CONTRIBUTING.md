# Guidelines to Contribute

The Caverns of the Vaal, is both a narrative, a story, and a setting, as well as a variety of game mechanics all put together as a Setting for D&D 5th Edition under the [OGL and SRD License](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf).

Contributions can be requested via pull request, where a Maintainer will discuss the pull request, and vet it using the following guidelines:

1. Does it fit the Setting? and add something meaningful?
2. Is the Grammar Correct, and does the writing flow well?
3. Does the Pull Request have appropriate formatting so it can be exported using the [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/)?  Basically this means that the user has written almost all of it, and tested it in the Homebrewery for formatting, picture clipping, and general flow.
4. If the Pull Request includes Art, or is just Art, is the artist attributed appropriately immediately under the Art. Written permission to use this art will also be required, unless you are the artist yourself.
5. Lastly and the most important, Does the pull request fit within the [Design Document](DESIGNDOCUMENT.md)?

The only exceptions to these guidelines are grammar corrections, and light flow corrections via Pull Request.

***Maintainers always reserve the right to deny any pull request without reason.***

# The Process

There is a process to contribute, if you haven't already, please read through the relevant parts of the [Design Document](DESIGNDOCUMENT.md) for your contribution to ensure that continuity is maintained.

**1.** **Because this is mostly a narrative work by myself [SaintFenix](https://github.com/SaintFenix), I don't want to get anyone's hopes up that a Pull Request will necessarily be accepted just because there is a lot of work in it. For this reason a Pull Request should be submitted first with an outline of proposed changes, and if they sound well and good, It'll be marked provisional.**

**2.** **Once Marked Provisional, the user may continue work until completed, and once completed it will be fully evaluated. This can be either writing, Art or both.**

**3.** **Once the evaluation is complete, I will merge it into the mainline.**

Once enough changes have been made from various pull requests, I'll arbitrarily decide to release either a point release or a new Edition.

If a pull request is submitted without reading this or going through the process, it will have a much larger chance of being declined.

# Unsure how to contribute?

Here are some resources to help get you started if you've never used Git before, and are lost on where to start.

Start with the Basics, once complete, using what you know about Markdown you should be able to then adapt that knowledge for use with Homebrewery which is basically Markdown, plus a few HTML extensions. PLEASE FAVOR MARKDOWN. Homebrewery has promised to remove HTML extensions in the program soon.

- Basics
  - [How to Use Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
  -[Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/why-atom/) - While you can use many text editors with Git to contribute, Atom is easy to use and a good beginner text editor for using with Git.
  - [How to Git from the Command Line](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) - If you are brave you can attempt to contribute from the Linux or Mac Command Lines. However you will require a browser to test your Markdown in Homebrewery.
  - [What is Markdown?](https://github.com/LewisVo/Markdown-Tutorial) - Markdown is the writing method used to create this list and is used on the [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) and the other top level Documents such as the README, and the License and Design Document. If you want to know how to format contributions properly, it's best that you learn how to use Markdown.

- Advanced
 - [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) - This is the "compiler" or official formatting of the "Caverns of the Vaal" Setting. All contributions must be written in this format in order to be accepted into the mainline.
